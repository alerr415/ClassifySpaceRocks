# ClassifySpaceRocks
 
## Written in Python with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code.
 
You will need Python AI libraries like matplotlib, numpy, PyTorch. You will need Anaconda as well. I used an Anaconda enviroment.
 
With this project I analyze and classify specifically two types of rocks that can be found in the surface of the Moon, highland and basalt.
 
The "Data" folder contains the images I use as dataset. 80% of it is used for training and the rest is used for testing. I left there the original zip folder just in case.
 
### The ClassifySpaceRockProgram.ipynb contains the neccesary code to build and train a deep neural network that can accurately identify what kind of rock is in a given image of the dataset.
 
Hopefully it can be easily expanded to identify more than 2 kinds of rocks.
